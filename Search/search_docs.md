## Fenced Code Blocks  

We format code using the backtick character. The backtick is on the same key as the tilde on a U.S. English keyboard, which is usually to the left of the number 1 and above the tab key.

You can use a single backtick to create inline code. For example, you may type something like this:

To install the latest version of NPM, you can type, `npm install npm@latest -g`

For multiple lines of code, you'll usually create a code block. Instead of one backtick, use three backticks above and below the code block.

```JavaScript
let exampleFunction = () =>{
    let foo = 'foo';
    let bar = 'bar';

    return foo + bar;
}

```
```python
def user_status():
  user = 'johnny'
  msg = 'The user {} is working.'.format(user)

```
output:  
`>>> The user johnny is working.`
